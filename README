This was written to decode some Brother WP-1 floppy disks which use a proprietary
format. The disks were read using fluxengine, an open-source and open-hardware
project. Fluxengine struggled with certain disks that were written to the wrong
media type. This script reads in a .flux file generated by fluxengine, which
contains a representation of the raw flux transitions read from the disk drive,
and uses a different set of algorithms to recover the data encoded therein. This
was able to fully recover several disks that were only partially recoverable using
fluxengine's decoder.
